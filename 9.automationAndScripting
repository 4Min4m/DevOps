🔄 Playbook-Driven Automation:
   - Ansible #playbooks serve as the backbone of #automation, providing a structured and readable way to define tasks, roles, and automation workflows.

*Implementation Guide: Setting Up Automation Tasks with Ansible

🌐 Objective: Automate Web Server Configuration

1. Playbook Creation:
   - Craft an Ansible playbook, the orchestration file that outlines the desired state of your infrastructure.

(yaml)
# Example Ansible Playbook (web_server_setup.yml)
---
- name: Configure Web Servers
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Update System Packages
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        upgrade: dist

    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

2. Inventory Management:
   - Define your infrastructure in the Ansible inventory file, specifying target servers for the playbook.

(ini)
# Example Ansible Inventory (inventory.ini)
[webservers]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102


3. Executing the Playbook:
   - Run the Ansible playbook to initiate the automated configuration of web servers.

(bash)
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini web_server_setup.yml

*Key Takeaways:

- ✔️ Ansible's YAML syntax in playbooks provides a human-readable and easy-to-write format.
- ✔️ The ad-hoc nature of Ansible allows for quick execution of tasks across multiple servers simultaneously.
