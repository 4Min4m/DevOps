🌐🚀 Monitoring, Logging, and Observability: Illuminating the DevOps Landscape! 🔄🔍



DevOps Navigators, welcome to the sixth step of our #DevOps learning journey, where we shift our focus to the crucial realms of monitoring, logging, and observability. In this phase, we'll explore the tools and practices that illuminate the performance and health of our applications, providing insights for proactive management.



*Why Monitoring, Logging, and Observability Matter:



🔍 Performance Insights:

   - Monitoring tools offer real-time visibility into system performance, enabling timely detection and response to issues.



📋 Centralized Logging

   - Logging solutions aggregate and centralize logs, offering a comprehensive view of application behavior and potential errors.



🌐 Observability for Understanding:

   - Observability goes beyond monitoring and logging, providing a holistic view of system behavior, dependencies, and interactions.



*Week Learning Plan: Illuminating the DevOps Landscape



📅 Day 1: Introduction to Monitoring

   - Explore the importance of monitoring in DevOps.

   - Practical: Set up a basic monitoring system.



📅 Day 2: Centralized Logging with ELK Stack

   - Dive into the ELK Stack (#Elasticsearch, #Logstash, #Kibana) for centralized logging.

   - Practical: Configure and use ELK Stack for log management.



📅 Day 3: Real-time Monitoring with #Prometheus and #Grafana

   - Introduce Prometheus for real-time monitoring and Grafana for visualization.

   - Practical: Set up a Prometheus-Grafana monitoring stack.



📅 Day 4: Application Performance Monitoring (#APM)

   - Understand APM tools for detailed insights into application performance.

   - Practical: Explore an APM tool with a sample application.



📅 Day 5: Distributed Tracing

   - Explore distributed tracing for tracing requests across #microservices.

   - Practical: Implement distributed tracing in a microservices architecture.
